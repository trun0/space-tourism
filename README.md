## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) - React Router Dom


### What I learned

I learned so many new things while doing this project:
I learned how to remove the hover states that persist on touch devices.
I learned how to deal with css properties efficiently which are not supported by some browsers.


### Continued development

I look forward to to learn new concepts of React and add some animations to this project.
